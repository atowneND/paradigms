dhc rest client - for debugging web stuff

OO graphics
-RESTful web service
 -> representational state transfer
 - url says everything about the request
 - literal interpretation of url
 - statelessness - server does not maintain state of client
 - event-driven philosophy in the server
-REST vs SOAP
 -> simple object access protocol

EVENTS:
- network traffic
- os "events"
- hardware events -> memory events ->
    -> source -> event queue -> dispatcher -> handler (may call other handlers)
- concurrency issues
    - dispatcher blocks on variable that indicates q is occupied

try tcpdump
