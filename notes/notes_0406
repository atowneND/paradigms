hard real time constraints vs soft RT constraints
late = failure                late = degraded performance
RTC
-> objects
    -> tick()
    -> next tick() (next object)
    * order matters (data dependencies)

7 steps
1. set up game space (initialize)
2. initialize game objects
3. start game loop
    4. tick regulation
    5. user input reading
    6. tick() all objects
    7. update screen/display
