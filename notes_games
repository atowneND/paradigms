Checkers:
- red goes first
- 8x8 board
- starting state - pieces opposite each other
- moves must be diagonal
- moves must be to an empty square or jump over an opposing piece
- end state: w/l decision

building blocks for ttt
- end of game detection (define winner (state)) => x, o, intermediate, draw
- (define value (state)) => -10 o wins; +10 x wins; 0 otherwise (see handout for sign)
starting with an empty board
-> initial state #
   -> 9 possible places for x to play
      -> 8 possible places for y to play (for each of the 9 x states)
      ...
      (729 end states?)
win states stop the tree
symmetry simplifies the tree (by rotation/reflection)
tree inherits the value of the winning state
